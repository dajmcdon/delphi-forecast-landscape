## The Forecasing task


.pull-left-wide[
* Every week, submit forecasts to [COVID-19 **Forecast**Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org)

* The first forecasts were submitted on 20 July 2020

* Originally "State Deaths"

* Added "County Cases" a bit later, and eventually "Hospitalizations"

* Hub also collects (now) a few other targets
]

.pull-right-narrow[

]

### The goal

* Forecasts from many teams are combined into an "ensemble"

* The ensemble generally has the best performance, and is the official [CDC Forecast](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#forecasting)

* Some members of ForecastHub and Delphi collaborate on [Ensemble creation](https://forecasters.org/blog/2020/10/28/comparing-ensemble-approaches-for-short-term-probabilistic-covid-19-forecasts-in-the-u-s/)

---

## The Forecasts


* "point" forecasts and "quantiles"

* Predict 1-4 epiweeks ahead (some targets)

* Predict 0-28 days ahead (hospitalizations)

* Some teams produce longer-term forecasts ...

## Time series (simplification)

> On day $t$, model hospitalizations at day $t+a$ as a function of today's hospitalizations and those in the recent past.


.secondary[For example:]

$$\widehat{y}_{t+a} = a_{0} y_{t} + a_{7}y_{t-7} + a_{14} y_{t-14} + b_0 x_t + b_{7} x_{t-7}$$

.secondary[COVIDhub Baseline:]

$$\widehat{y}_{t+a} = y_{t}$$

* Seemingly, straightforward to do.
* Performs surprisingly well, most of the time.
* Not so good when you'd most want it to work.
* Uses essentially no information about epidemics.

## SIR-type (compartmental) models - Stochastic Version

(Borrowed heavily from [Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/dst/20/lectures/20/lecture-20.html), Ryan Tibshirani, [Dean Karlen](https://pypm.github.io/home/docs/studies/reports/Characterizing_spread.pdf))



.pull-left[
Suppose each of N people in a bucket at time t:

1. .large[.fourth-color[Susceptible(t)]] : not sick, but could get sick
1. .large[.secondary[Infected(t)]] : sick, can make others sick
1. .large[.tertiary[Removed(t)]] : either recovered or dead; not sick, can't get sick, can't make anyone sick


<hr>

**Assume**: During period h, each .fourth-color[S] meets kh people.  
**Assume**: Prob( .fourth-color[S] meets .secondary[I] and becomes .secondary[I] ) = c.  
.fourth-color[So]: Prob( .fourth-color[S] $\rightarrow$ .secondary[I] ) = $1 - (1 - c I(t)  / N )^{hk} \approx kchI(t) / N$  
.fourth-color[So]: New .secondary[I] in time h $\sim Binom(S(t),\ kchI(t) / N)$  
**Assume**: Prob( .secondary[I] $\rightarrow$ .tertiary[R]) = $\gamma h$  
.fourth-color[So]: Sew removals in time h $\sim Binom(I(t),\ \gamma h)$

### Over-all equations:

\begin{aligned}
C(t+h) & =  \mathrm{Binom}\left(S(t),\ \frac{\beta}{N} h I(t)\right)\\
D(t+h) & =  \mathrm{Binom}\left(I(t),\ \gamma h\right)\\
S(t+h) & =  S(t) - C(t+h)\\
I(t+h) & =  I(t) + C(t+h) - D(t+h)\\
R(t+h) & =  R(t) + D(t+h)
\end{aligned}

### In the deterministic limit, 

$N\rightarrow\infty,\ h\rightarrow 0$

\begin{aligned}
N &= S(0) + I(0) + R(0)\\
\frac{dS}{dt} & =  -\frac{\beta}{N} S(t)I(t)\\
\frac{dI}{dt} & =  \frac{\beta}{N} I(t)S(t) - \gamma I(t)\\
\frac{dR}{dt} & =  \gamma I(t)
\end{aligned}

**"_the_ SIR model"** is often ambiguous between these

## Adding complexity


.pull-left[

* Vanilla SIR is not very interesting, not good for forecasting

* Gives intuition for how an epidemic grows, hits a peak, decreases

.secondary[Dean Karlen] [.secondary[pyPM]](https://pypm.github.io/home/)
* Discrete difference version
* Extra compartments for VOCs, Hospitalizations, deaths, ICU, others
* Estimated with Conditional Least Squares
* Includes "Case Injections", estimated and forced changes in $\beta$
* (Really a whole `python` package for creating compartmental models)
* No age structure
* Location specific

## More complexity - Agent Based Models

.secondary[Take it to the extreme:]

 - Mirror the model for different age buckets
 - Different types of activity people might engage in (lock downers, mixers, covid deniers, etc)
 - Perhaps different cities or even suburbs
 - Allow all these to interact with each other
 
--
 
.secondary[This is essentially an Agent Based Model]

* Fix or calibrate a huge pile of parameters
* Simulate how all these agents behave
* Then see what happens

## How do different kinds do?


* Research project (among other things)

* Use forecasts to cluster the teams. Maybe compare with Metadata.
